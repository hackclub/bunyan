# @Paul Bunyan

_Work inspired by [@streambot](https://github.com/hackclub/streambot)._

@Paul Bunyan (pictured to the right) logs everything happening in the Hack Club
Slack. Posts, reactions, etc. all get tracked so he can help you understand
where the activity in the Slack is.

## How to use

Ask Paul Bunyan what's happening in the Slack by typing `/sup`– he'll respond with a list of 5 recently active channels in the last 2 hours:

Want to query a specific channel, user, or emoji?

You can run any of these:

- `/supwit @orpehus` _Where has @orpheus been active recently?_
- `/supwit 30 @orpehus` _Where has @orpheus been active in the last 30 minutes?_
- `/supwit :yay:` _Where has the :yay: reaction been used recently?_
- `/supwit 45 :yay:` _Where has the :yay: reaction been used in the last 45 min?_
- `/supwit #lounge` _What's happening in #lounge?_
- `/supwit 60 #lounge` _What's been happening in #lounge over the past 60 min_

## What can @Paul Bunyan see?

If you want to opt-in or opt-out of logging (for yourself or a channel), type
`@Paul Bunyan help`– he's an all-around great guy and will do his best to
accomodate whatever you're trying to do.
